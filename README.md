# GoGGoNEMO
Collection of scripts to set-up and loop NEMO on PMSN at ENS de Lyon, France. Named in honour of the Go-Go-Mobil (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvOz_qUPbXo). Suggestions/pull requests for improvements welcome!

Note, we had to use a workaround because pmsn did not have ksh.

# Requirements
Python
f90nml

# Instructions
See setupNEMO_ARC2.py. 

## For the user to add
Note in this case, there are additional xml files and a namelist_ref, these were for the isomip_plus case (merged with namelist_ref from the SHARED folder) that Louis was working off using nemo4.2.1. see also nemo post https://cbull.info/nemo4/nemo4-PSMN-E5-01/
